TBTC v2 can be\n///         unminted back to TBTC v1 with or without a fee - fee parameter is\n///         controlled by the Governance. This implementation acts as a bridge\n///         between TBTC v1 and TBTC v2 token, allowing to mint TBTC v2 before\n///         the system is ready and fully operational without sacrificing any\n///         security guarantees and decentralization of the project.\n///         Vending Machine can be upgraded in a two-step, governance-controlled\n///         process. The new version of the Vending Machine will receive the\n///         ownership of TBTC v2 token and entire TBTC v1 balance stored as\n///         collateral. It is expected that this process will be executed before\n///         the v2 system launch. There is an optional unmint fee with a value\n///         that can be updated in a two-step, governance-controlled process.\n///         All governable parameters are controlled by two roles: update\n///         initiator and finalizer.
