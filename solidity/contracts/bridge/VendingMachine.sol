/// @notice The Vending Machine is the owner of TBTC v2 token and can mint
///         TBTC v2 tokens in 1:1 ratio from TBTC v1 tokens with TBTC v1
///         deposited in the contract as collateral. TBTC v2 can be
///         unminted back to TBTC v1 with or without a fee - fee parameter is
///         controlled by the Governance. This implementation acts as a bridge
///         between TBTC v1 and TBTC v2 token, allowing to mint TBTC v2 before
///         the system is ready and fully operational without sacrificing any
///         security guarantees and decentralization of the project.
///         Vending Machine can be upgraded in a two-step, governance-controlled
///         process. The new version of the Vending Machine will receive the
///         ownership of TBTC v2 token and entire TBTC v1 balance stored as
///         collateral. It is expected that this process will be executed before
///         the v2 system launch. There is an optional unmint fee with a value
///         that can be updated in a two-step, governance-controlled process.
///         All governable parameters are controlled by two roles: update
///         initiator and finalizer. There is a separate initiator role for
///         unmint fee update and vending machine upgrade. The initiator
///         proposes the change by initiating the update and the finalizer
///         (contract owner) may approve it by finalizing the change after the
///         governance delay passes.
