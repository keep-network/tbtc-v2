///         redemption operations performed by depositors and redeemers.
///
///         Depositors send BTC funds to the most recently created off-chain
///         ECDSA wallet of the bridge using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) or
///         pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) containing hashed information

///         their Ethereum address along with their deposit blinding factor,
///         refund public key hash and refund locktime to the Bridge on Ethereum
///         chain. The off-chain ECDSA wallet listens for these sorts of
///         messages and when it gets one, it checks the Bitcoin network to make
///         sure the deposit lines up. If it does, the off-chain ECDSA wallet
///         may decide to pick the deposit transaction for sweeping, and when
///         the sweep operation is confirmed on the Bitcoin network, the ECDSA
///         wallet informs the Bridge about the sweep increasing appropriate
///         balances in the Bank.
