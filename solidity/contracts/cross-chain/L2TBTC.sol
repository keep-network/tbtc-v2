/// @title L2TBTC
/// @notice Canonical L2/sidechain token implementation. tBTC token is minted on
///         L1 and locked there to be moved to L2/sidechain. By deploying
///         a canonical token on each L2/sidechain, we can ensure the supply of
///         tBTC remains sacrosanct, while enabling quick, interoperable
///         cross-chain bridges and localizing ecosystem risk.
///
///         This contract is flexible enough to:
///         - Delegate minting authority to a native bridge on the chain, if
///           present.
///         - Delegate minting authority to a short list of ecosystem bridges.
///         - Have mints and burns paused by any one of n guardians, allowing
///           avoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific
///           incident.
///         - Be governed and upgradeable.
///
///         The token is burnable by the token holder and supports EIP2612
///         permits. Token holder can authorize a transfer of their token with
///         a signature conforming EIP712 standard instead of an on-chain
///         transaction from their address. Anyone can submit this signature on
///         the user's behalf by calling the permit function, paying gas fees,
///         and possibly performing other actions in the same transaction.
///         The governance can recover ERC20 and ERC721 tokens sent mistakenly
///         to L2TBTC token contract.
