/// @title L1BTCRedeemerWormhole
/// @notice This contract is part of the direct bridging mechanism allowing
///         users to redeem ERC20 tBTC from a supported chain (L2) back to
///         Bitcoin, without the need to interact directly with the L1 tBTC
///         ledger chain where the redemption is processed.
///
///         `L1BTCRedeemerWormhole` is deployed on the L1 chain and interacts with
///         its destination chain counterpart (e.g., `L2BTCRedeemer` on an L2 chain).
///         Each `L1BTCRedeemerWormhole` & `L2BTCRedeemer` (or equivalent)
///         pair is responsible for a specific L2 chain.
///
///         The outline of the direct redemption mechanism is as follows:
///         1. An L2 user initiates a redemption request on the L2 chain, specifying
///            the amount of tBTC to redeem and their Bitcoin destination address.
///         2. The L2 contract sends this request (via a cross-chain message via Wormhole VAA) 
///            to the `L1BTCRedeemerWormhole` on L1.
///         3. The `L1BTCRedeemerWormhole` receives the tBTC from the L2 (via the token bridge)
///            and then calls the tBTC `Bridge` contract on L1 to request the redemption,
///            providing the user's Bitcoin address.
///         4. The tBTC `Bridge` handles the redemption process, and the user eventually
///            receives Bitcoin in their specified address.
///         5. Relayers (or other authorized entities) might be involved in facilitating
///            the cross-chain communication and L1 transaction submissions, potentially
///            eligible for gas reimbursement.
