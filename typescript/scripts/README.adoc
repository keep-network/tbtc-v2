== Refund script

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >=16
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >=1.22.19

tBTCv2 system prerequisite is that you can refund your BTC only if it was not used 
for minting tBTC and after `refundLocktime` has passed.
In practice, you should wait about an hour longer than the `refundLocktime` since
this is how Bitcoin handles time based transactions.
Currently the `refundLocktime` is set to 9 months.

=== Running a refund script

Step 1. Clone https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2[tbtc-v2] repository to your 
local disc. `git clone https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2`

Step 2. Navigate to a root directory and run the following command with your arguments:
```
./typescript/scripts/refund.sh \
    --deposit-json-path <deposit-JSON-file-path> \
    --deposit-amount <deposit-amount> \
    --deposit-transaction-id <deposit-transaction-id> \
    --deposit-transaction-index <deposit-transaction-index> \
    --private-key <recoverer-private-key> \
    --transaction-fee <transaction-fee> \
    --electrum-host <client-host> \
    --electrum-port <client-port> \
    --electrum-protocol <client-protocol>
```

- `deposit-JSON-file-path` Path to a file that you downloaded during the BTC 
deposit in the Threshold dApp.
- `deposit-amount` Exact BTC amount in satoshi that was deposited. It will not process a 
partial refund.
- `deposit-transaction-id` A transaction ID of your BTC deposit.
- `deposit-transaction-index` A transaction index of your deposit UTXO that can 
be retrieved from a Bitcoin blockchain explorer. If it's first on the list then 
the index is 0, if it's second then the index is 1, etc.
- `private-key` A private key of the BTC recovery wallet. If you only have a 
passphrase, one of the options is to extract your private keys by using a
mnemonic code converter website (can be extracted offline) or desktop Electrum Wallet.
- `transaction-fee` A Bitcoin chain transaction fee that you are willing to pay. 
With a median transaction size at 255 bytes or 141 bytes segwit tx you should 
expect to set a fee between 1300-2700 satoshis.
