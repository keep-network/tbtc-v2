== Refund script

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >=16
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >=1.22.19

tBTCv2 system prerequisite is that you can refund your BTC only if it was not used 
for minting tBTC and after `refundLocktime` has passed.
In practice, you should wait about an hour longer than the `refundLocktime` since
this is how Bitcoin handles time based transactions.
Currently the `refundLocktime` is set to 9 months.

=== Running a refund script

Step 1. Clone https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2[tbtc-v2] repository to your 
local disc. `git clone https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2`

Step 2. Navigate to a root directory and run the following command with your arguments:
```
./typescript/scripts/refund.sh \
    --deposit-json-path <deposit-JSON-file-path> \
    --deposit-amount <deposit-amount> \
    --deposit-transaction-id <deposit-transaction-id> \
    --deposit-transaction-index <deposit-transaction-index> \
    --private-key <recoverer-private-key> \
    --transaction-fee <transaction-fee> \
    --electrum-host <client-host> \
    --electrum-port <client-port> \
    --electrum-protocol <client-protocol>
```

- `deposit-JSON-file-path` Path to a file that you downloaded during the BTC 
deposit in the Threshold dApp.
- `deposit-amount` Exact BTC amount in satoshi that was deposited. It will not process a 
partial refund.
- `deposit-transaction-id` A transaction ID of your BTC deposit.
- `deposit-transaction-index` A transaction index of your deposit UTXO that can 
be retrieved from a Bitcoin blockchain explorer. If it's first on the list then 
the index is 0, if it's second then the index is 1, etc.
- `private-key` A private key of the BTC recovery wallet. If you only have a 
passphrase, one of the options is to extract your private keys by using a
mnemonic code converter website (can be extracted offline) or desktop Electrum Wallet.
- `transaction-fee` A Bitcoin chain transaction fee that you are willing to pay. 
With a median transaction size at 255 bytes or 141 bytes segwit tx you should 
expect to set a fee between 1300-2700 satoshis.
- `electrum-host` Electrum client host
- `electrum-port` Electrum client server port
- `electrum-protocol` Electrum client protocol, e.g. wss, ws or tcp

Step 3. Check your wallet. Upon successful execution your BTC should be recovered.
Please note that the transaction fee was deducted from your deposit.
