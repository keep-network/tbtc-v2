to integrate tBTC into their own applications and offer the power of
trustless tokenized Bitcoin to their users.

## Quickstart

Here you can find instructions explaining how to use the SDK in your own
project.

### Installation

To install the tBTC SDK in your project using `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn add @keep-network/tbtc-v2.ts
```

If you prefer to use `npm`, do:

```bash
npm i @keep-network/tbtc-v2.ts
```

Please note that you will also need to install the
[ethers v5](https://docs.ethers.org/v5) library to initialize
a signer or provider. To do so using `yarn`, invoke:

```bash
yarn add ethers@legacy-v5
```

To do the same using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm i ethers@legacy-v5
```

> The SDK depends on ethers v5. Proper support for newer ethers versions
> is not guaranteed right now.

### Usage

Here is a short example demonstrating SDK usage:

```typescript
// Import SDK entrypoint component.
import { TBTC } from "@keep-network/tbtc-v2.ts"

// Create an instance of ethers signer.
const signer = (...)

// Initialize the SDK.
const sdk = await TBTC.initializeMainnet(signer)

// Access SDK features.
sdk.deposits.(...)
sdk.redemptions.(...)

// Access tBTC smart contracts directly.
sdk.tbtcContracts.(...)

// Access Bitcoin client directly.
sdk.bitcoinClient.(...)
```
