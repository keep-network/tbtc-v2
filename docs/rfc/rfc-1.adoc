== Overview

=== Depositing

Stakers periodically create <<group-size,51-of-100>> ecdsa-backed wallets
to hold frozen BTC assets to maintain account balances. Depositors send BTC
funds to the most-recently-created-wallet by using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH)
which contains hashed information about the depositor's minting ethereum
address. Once the block is mined, the depositor reveals their desired ethereum
minting address to the ethereum chain. The bridge listens for these sorts
of messages and when it gets one, it checks the bitcoin network to make sure
the funds line up. If everything checks out, then we update your ethereum-side
account balance.

=== Redemption

A user with an account balance supplies a bitcoin address. The system decreases
their account balance and releases the equivalent amount of bitcoin to the user
from the redeeming bitcoin wallet.

The redeeming wallet will be determined by the system on chain via an upgradable
(by governance) contract. The initial implementation for this contract should
select the oldest wallet. Redemptions should be batched (details to be
determined) to both decrease fees and processing time.

One possible implementation for efficient on-chain calculation of the oldest wallet
is to store the wallet information in a tree similar to what we use for sortition
pools, ensuring that no matter how many wallets we have active, the cost of
finding a wallet is always logarithmic over the maximum number of wallets during
the system's lifetime.

The maximum redemption size is capped by the size of the largest wallet, and
any redemption bigger than that will need to be split into multiple
redemptions.

[[continuous-fees]]
=== Continuous Fees

The system is able to collect fees in the form of tBTC when the BTC is
deposited and when it is redeemed. Rather than paying operators at those two
instances we would prefer to pay them continuously. Since we do not have the
tBTC to pay them with until we collect the redemption fee (and can't mint it
and maintain the peg), we must turn to another token. Instead, the system pays
operators in T tokens from a treasury funded by the T-token DAO and whenever it
collects tBTC fees it uses those fees to buy T tokens back for its treasury.

=== Minting And Unminting

A user with a swept account balance can drain their account balance to mint TBTC.
Similarly, a user can burn TBTC to refill their account balance.

A user with a swept account balance can drain their account balance to redeem BTC.

== In Depth

[[group-size]]
=== Group Size

Governable Parameters:

- `threshold`: The number of signers that can be controlled by the adversary
  before the key is in danger.
- `heartbeat`: The number of group members required for a
  <<heartbeat,heartbeat>> to be successful.
- `dkg`: The minimum number of members we're allowed to drop down to during the
  DKG group formation re-try period.
- `group_size`: The total size of the signing group.

`threshold < heartbeat < dkg < group_size`

The total gas cost for sortiton increases linearly with group size by at least
20k gas per member (though, we think we can get this down to roughly 6k gas per
member in the happy path with some upcoming optimizations). Requiring more
signers to sign messages makes it harder for adversaries to take over the
group, but makes it so that the pool is less resilient to undelegation or
operators going offline. Raising `heartbeat` decreases the chance that you'll
not have enough signers to sign transactions, but decreases a wallets lifespan
and increases overhead. Lowering `dkg` increases the chance that we're able to
create a wallet successfully but gives us a wallet with potentially fewer
operators and a lower lifespan.

Also important is optics - even though a `group_size` of 70 with a `threshold`
of 40 is equally secure against being controlled by an adversary as a
`group_size` of 100 with a `threshold` of 50, it might not _feel_ as secure.
That perception may cause a decreased willingness to invest capital in the
system leading to less money going over the bridge, even though the fees are
less overall.

Since we don't have any workable data that allows us to reasonably estimate
costs (especially with regard to optics), I suggest we start the system out
at decent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)[schelling
point] of `group_size = 100`, `threshold = 50`, `heartbeat = 70`, `dkg = 90` and then let
governance adjust from there once we've gathered data from the system being used.

See link:rfc-2.adoc[RFC 2: tBTCv2 Group Selection and Key Generation] for a deeper dive here

=== Account Balances

The bridge is able to maintain a clean separation of concerns as well as provide the backbone
an extensible financial system rooted in bitcoin-on-ethereum by concerning itself _just_ with
how much bitcoin has gone over the bridge. We keep track of account balances like:
```
contract Balances {
  mapping(address => uint256) private unsweptBalances;
  mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
}
```

When bitcoin enters the system, the associated account's unsweptBalance
increases. When that deposit is swept, that amount is tranfered to the balance.
_If_ a user decides to mint a TBTC bitcoin from their balance, their balance
would be drained and a TBTC token would be minted. When a user brings back TBTC
to the system, the token is burned and the account balance increases. If the
user wants BTC, they can drain their account balance to redeem it.

This more abstract design lets us not only do things like mint TBTC by draining
account balances, but also move into other financial concepts like
bitcoin-collateralized loans or bitcoin-backed stablecoins.

Neither of the above concepts are in-scope for this RFC, but the important part
is that we want to make sure we're starting with the more flexible
account-balances design so that we're not stuck later.

=== Depositing

==== Deposit + Commitment

Once we know the active wallet's public key hash, the dApp can put together a
pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address to receive the funds. This script will be
unique to each depositor and will look like:

```
<eth-address> DROP
<blinding-factor> DROP
DUP HASH160 <signingGroupPubkey> EQUAL
IF
  CHECKSIG
ELSE
  DUP HASH160 <refundPubkey> EQUALVERIFY
  <locktime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
  CHECKSIG
ENDIF
```

Since each depositor has their own ethereum address and their own secret
blinding factor (which is an additional security layer), each depositor's
script will be unique, and the hash of each depositor's script will be unique.

In order to unlock the funds, one must provide the unhashed script, (which
means that they know the eth address and blinding factor), as well as an
unlocking script with a signature and public key. If the sig+pubkey matches the
signing group public key, the funds are able to be moved immediately. If the
sig+pubkey matches the refund public key, then the funds can be moved after 30
days (specified as `locktime`).

==== The Big Reveal

Governable Parameters:

- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between sweeps.

After the deposit transaction has been mined, the user is able to reveal their
ethereum address and blinding factor to the ethereum chain. The bridge listens
for these sorts of messages and when it sees one, is able to generate a script that
can spend the funds. Once successful, we increase the account's unswept balance
and charge a deposit fee.

Addtionally and optionally, as a part of the reveal transaction, the user the
declare that they want their swept funds to be immediately minted into TBTC.
This saves the user from having to make separate transactions or wait for a
sweep to occur before an additional transaction.

Second, we schedule an operation that batches all outstanding known-refundable
transactions together to be combined with the existing wallet output into a
single output. The frequency of this operation is the `sweep_period`. When this
<<sweeping,sweep>> occurs, we decrease the relevant accounts' unswept balances
and increase their balances. This disables any outstanding 30-day refunds.

==== Automated Refunds

A bitcoin transaction is an amount and a script. The script can be something as
simple as "these funds can be spent by wallet 0xabc", or in our case, as
complex as "these funds can be spent by wallet 0xabc but if they aren't spent
within 30 days they can be spent by wallet 0x123". This gives us the ability to
create deposits that automatically are refunded after 30 days if they aren't
<<sweeping,swept>>. Thus, if a user misfunds or they get cold feet (for any
reason), all they need to do is not submit their reveal and wait 30 days.

[[sweeping]]
==== Sweeping

Governable Parameters

- `sweeping_refund_safety_time`: The amount of time prior to when a UTXO
  becomes eligible for a refund where we will not include it in a sweeping
  transaction.
- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between sweeps.
- `sweep_max_btc`: The amount of summed unswept bitcoin deposits that will
  trigger an early sweep.
- `dust_threshold`: The minimum bitcoin deposit amount for the transaction to
  be included in a sweep.
- `sweeping_fee_bump_period`: The amount of time we wait to see if a sweeping
  tranaction is mined before increasing the fee.
- `sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment`: The amount we add to the sweeping fee
  multiplier each time a sweeping transaction is not mined within the
  `sweeping_fee_bump_period`. For example, if this param is set to 0.2 and we
  are currently at 1.6x, then the next time we would try 1.8x.
- `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`: The highest we will try to increment the fee
  multiplier to before giving up and picking a new base fee and different
  deposits to sweep.


The operators sign a transaction that unlocks some of revealed deposits based
on the <<bitcoin-sweeping-fee,bitcoin sweeping fee>>, combines them into a
single UTXO with the existing UTXO, and relocks that transactions without a
30-day refund clause to same wallet.  This has two main effects: it
consolidates the UTXO set and it disables the refund.

*Caveat*: We only include deposits in batches that have at least
`sweeping_refund_safety_time` their refund window. This prevents potential
attacks or corner cases where we create a transaction with a valid, unspent
input, but by the time we have signed that transaction, the depositor has
already submitted a refund to the mining pool. Giving ourselves this leeway
stops that from happening.  Once a deposit crosses that
`sweeping_refund_safety_time` threshold, the depositor should wait and then
refund their deposit.

*Caveat*: A wallet only sweeps deposits that were deposited while while the
wallet was either the youngest or second-youngest wallet. The dApp will only
point deposits to the youngest wallet, so any other wallet receiving deposits
is the result of funky custom user behavior. In those cases, the users will
need to wait 30 days for their refund.

This process is called a "sweep", and occurs after `sweep_period` has passed or
if enough deposits have accumulated to exceed `sweep_max_btc`, whichever comes
first. Any deposit below `dust_threshold` is ignored, both for triggering a
sweep as well as being included in a sweep.

*Caveat*: Checking to see if enough deposits have accumulated to exceed
`sweep_max_btc` is complex. Since whether or not we pick a deposit to include
in a sweep is based on their associated fee and the bitcoin fee market
conditions, we have to check the going market rate for a bitcoin fee, and then
do some bin-packing to see which deposits we can allow in. The more deposits,
the low the per-deposit fee is (because they can share costs). Once we have
enough deposits to exceed `sweep_max_btc`, we should check the market
conditions for the btc fee and then off-chain see which deposits *would be*
swept if we *were* to sweep. If the sum of those deposits exceeds the
`sweep_max_btc` parameter, then we should initiate a sweep.

The sweeping transaction will cost some amount of bitcoin based on what miners
are charging for the bitcoin fee in the current market conditions. The fee is
split in proportion to the number of UTXOs associated to each depositor. Once
the transaction is submitted to the bitcoin mempool, the miners will either
include it in a block within `sweeping_fee_bump_period` or not. If they don't,
then we increment a fee multiplier: `fee_multiplier = fee_multiplier +
sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment` and then calculate the new fee: `fee =
base_fee * fee_multiplier`. We repeat until either the transaction posts or
`sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment` exceeds `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`.

*Note*: In terms of bin-packing eligibility, we only include deposits whose
associated fee is higher than the highest fee we could iterate to given
`sweeping_fee_max_multiplier` and `base_fee`. We also only include deposits
whose refund date fits within the `sweeping_refund_safety_time` for the worst
case with respect to transaction retries for increasing the fee.

When the transaction clears, and the information has made its way
over the relay maintainer, then another transaction needs to be created to on
the ethereum side to update the account balances. The users unswept balances
are decreased, and their swept balances are increased (after paying their share
of the <<bitcoin-sweeping-fee,bitcoin sweeping fee>>).

This transaction will be expensive gas-wise, and can be submitted by anyone
with the motivation to do so. For more details on transaction incentives,
check out the <<transaction-incentives,dedicated section>>.

*Caveat*: The `sweeping_fee_bump_period` and `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`
parameters should be constrained such that one sweep should either finish and
either post or fail before the next sweep is scheduled (via `sweep_period`) to
start. This is because sweeps include the main UTXO as one of the inputs, which
is the result of the previous sweep's output.

The main downside to this approach is that it can take, in the worst case, up
to `sweep_period` for a user to be able to mint TBTC. To help
alleviate this, two suggestions:

1) We surface when the next scheduled sweep and the accumulation threshold
data is somewhere in the dApp. This allows users to feel a lot better about
when sweeps are happening, and feel better about when their funds will be
available. There is also something to be said about the marketing around
explaining that we're batching in order to reduce fees across the board for the
end user, which allows for the decentralized product to compete with the
centralized ones.

2) We allow users to request that their TBTC is minted as soon as they have a
swept account balance. This makes it so they don't have to wait, check, and
come back later and mint.

Combining these ideas, a user would deposit some BTC, reveal their eth address
and blinding factor, and then request that TBTC gets minted ASAP. Checking the
dApp, they can see that they should expect TBTC in their provided wallet
address in 3 hours with no further interaction.

===== Deposit Overflow

Governable Parameters

- `wallet_max_btc`: The amount of btc a wallet can hold before we trigger the
  early creation of a new wallet.
- `wallet_overflow_btc`: The amount of btc a wallet can hold before we begin
  refunding deposits.

If a deposit pushes a wallet past `wallet_max_btc`, we accept a partial amount
up to `wallet_max_btc`, and then refund the rest to the address supplied in
`refundPubkey` in the deposit.

*Example*: A wallet current has 38 btc, and has a `wallet_overflow_btc` of 40btc. A
user with a `refundPubkey` of `0x8f1` and eth address of `0x37a` deposits 5
btc. They would receive a 2 btc account balance (minus fees) at `0x37a` and a 3
btc refund (minus fees) at `0x8f1`.

This is a last-resort type situation! The reason we have `wallet_overflow_btc` is to
limit the amount of btc the adversary could potentially steal by having control
of one wallet. In the above example, the adversary *temporarily* has control
over 43 btc, and can choose to *not* refund it. Larger overflow deposits could
potentially wreck the coverage pools.

Ideally, governance sets `wallet_max_btc` so that normal user behavior triggers
new wallet creation without having users unexpectedly get their btc refunded.

=== Redemption

Governable Parameters:

`wallet_min_btc`: The smallest amount of btc a wallet can hold before we
  attempt to close the wallet and transfer the funds to a randomly selected
  wallet.

To initiate a redemption, a user with a swept balance > `x` supplies a bitcoin
address. Then, the system calculates the redemption fee `fee`, and releases an
amount of bitcoin `y` such that `x = y + fee` to the supplied bitcoin address.
The remaining `fee` sold by the system to buy back `T` tokens (more about this
process in the <<continuous-fees,fee section>>) to pay to the operators.

In the MVP version of the system, a redemption is capped at the amount of
bitcoin contained in the largest wallet. The wallet doing the redemption is
selected by the redeemer, but the dApp should suggest that this is the oldest
wallet that contains enough bitcoin to fulfil the redemption. If more BTC
needs to be redeemed than there is in the largest wallet, then the user needs
to submit multiple redemptions. After a redemption, if the wallet has under
`wallet_min_btc` remaining, it transfers that BTC to a randomly selected wallet
and closes.

==== Fraud Proof

When a redemption is requested, the redeeming bitcoin public key and amount are
known on the ethereum chain. Any bitcoin transactions with the main wallet
wallet UTXO as the input must have outputs that match those known redemption
requests, otherwise the transaction was fraudulent.

=== Wallet Lifecycle

Governable Parameters:

- `wallet_creation_period`: How frequently we attempt to create new wallets.
- `wallet_min_btc`: The smallest amount of btc a wallet can hold before we
  attempt to close the wallet and transfer the funds to a randomly selected
  wallet.
- `wallet_max_btc`: The amount of btc a wallet can hold before we trigger the
  early creation of a new wallet.
- `wallet_max_age`: The oldest we allow a wallet to become before we transfer the funds
  to a randomly selected wallet.

A new wallet is created when either enough time has passed as defined in
`wallet_creation_period` *AND* the wallet contains at least
`wallet_min_btc` btc *OR* the wallet currently contains more btc than
`wallet_max_btc`, whichever happens first. To create a new wallet, a group of
100 operators is selected from the pool of available operators using a process
called sortition. The probabiliy that a particular operator is chosen is based
on their stake weight, which in turn is based on the number of `T` tokens they
have invested in the staking contract.

Once the operators have been selected from the sortition pool, they generate a
51-of-100 ecdsa signing group to handle the bitcoin key material per the
process described in link:rfc-2.adoc[RFC 2: tBTCv2 Group Selection and Key
Generation]. The group size may end up being smaller depending on retries.

As time passes and operators drop out of the system, a wallet becomes at risk
of being able to meet the 51-of-100 threshold to produce signatures.
Additionally, we want to avoid situations where operators are the custodians of
a wallet for extended periods. To avoid these issues, once a wallet is older
than the `wallet_max_age`, or if it drops below the liveness threshold (say, below 70 on
a <<heartbeat,heartbeat>>), we motion to transfer the funds to another randomly
selected wallet.

Once a wallet no longer has funds and is not the primary wallet for new
deposits, it can be closed and operators are no longer required to maintain
it.

[[heartbeat]]
=== Heartbeats

Governable Parameters:

- `failed_heartbeat_reward_removal_period`: The amount of time an operator is
  removed from reward eligibility after failing a heartbeat.
- `heartbeat`: The number of group members required for a heartbeat to successful.
- `heartbeat_block_length`: The number of ethereum blocks until the next heartbeat.
  If set to 40, then the signers sign every 40th block.

To make sure that older wallets are still accessible for redemption, we need to
perform heartbeats. The signing group signs a block when block count mod
`heartbeat_block_length` = 0 and then does _not_ publish the result. If there
are ever less than `heartbeat` operators that participate in the heartbeat, the
ones that did can create and sign a new transaction that lists the _inactive_
operators. Once this transaction is posted to the ethereum chain, we can
iterate through the inactive operators, remove them from reward eligibility
for `failed_heartbeat_reward_removal_period` amount of time, transfer the remaining
btc from the wallet to another random wallet and close this wallet.

[[transaction-incentives]]
=== Transaction Incentives

[[bitcoin-sweeping-fee]]
=== Bitcoin Sweeping Fee

Governable Parameters
- `bridge_deposit_percentage_fee`: The percentage fee for depositing bitcoin.
- `bridge_deposit_flat_fee`: The flat fee for depositing bitcoin.

Any time a bitcoin transaction needs to be posted and then mined on the bitcoin
blockchain, the miners need to be paid a fee for their work. This fee
fluctuates with market demand and is decently volatile.

When the depositor posts their address reveal on ethereum, they include a
bitcoin `max_fee` denominated in total BTC that they're willing to pay for
three different fees:

- `bridge_deposit_percentage_fee` (say 0.2% or whatever governance decides)
- `bridge_deposit_flat_fee` (say 0.001 mBTC or whatever governance decides) to
  deter folks from depositing dust
- the mining fee for getting the batch sweeping transaction to post

Next, we hash the most recent ethereum block to generate the seed for a random
number generator to generate a modulus that selects a random unlucky operator
that needs to check the blockstream api for the 25-block target fee:
https://blockstream.info/api/fee-estimates and then post that information to
the ethereum chain. The 25-block target fee from blockstream is per vByte, so
we need to know how many vBytes will be in the transaction, which will depend
on how many inputs will be in the transaction, which will depend on how many
deposits we will sweep, which will depend on how many deposits find the target
fee palatable.

In order to include a deposit in the transaction, we will end up needing to do
some bin-packing. The more deposits we're able to include in a transaction the
lower the per-depositor mining fee is (because we get batched cost savings).
Thus, the more eligible depositors there are, the more eligible depositors
there are (hence the bin-packing). For a more in-depth explanation of how
deposits are chosen, check out <<sweeping,sweeping>>

After a particular fee has been chosen and all of the deposits have been selected,
that deposit might not mine within the timeout period. If this happens, the
unlucky operator should submit a transaction on-chain to multiply the fee by a
fixed amount (like 1.1x, 1.2x, etc up to some cap like 1.4x). With this in mind,
we should only include deposits in the initial transaction whose `max_fee` is set
high enough to withstand a fee increase up to whatever the maximum multiplier is.
