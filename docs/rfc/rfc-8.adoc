== Goal

The goal of this proposal is to enable *efficient* cross-chain tBTC liquidity.

In the Ethereum ecosystem, that means bringing Bitcoin to L2s and sidechains like
Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain. In the Cosmos
ecosystem, that means Bitcoin on IBC-enabled zones (chains) like Osmosis and
Penumbra. And in newer ecosystems, that means chains like Solana, Aptos, and
Sui.

Efficiency requires minimizing liquidity fragmentation by avoiding the need for
tBTC wrapper tokens by each chain and bridge. This situation quickly leads to an
`n*m` problem, where liquidity on `n` chains is divided between `m`
bridges. Each of these token variants soaks up valuable liquidity that could be
better utilized elsewhere.

Because tBTC is minted "centrally" on Ethereum L1, we can do better. By
deploying a canonical token on each chain, we can ensure the supply of tBTC
remains sacrosanct, while enabling quick, interoperable cross-chain bridges and
localizing ecosystem risk.

== Overview

To achieve this goal, I propose we deploy a canonical tBTC contract on each
chain we support. This contract should be flexible enough to:

* Delegate restricted minting authority to a native bridge on the chain, if
  present.
* Delegate restricted minting authority to a short list of ecosystem bridges
* Be paused by any one of `n` guardians, allowing avoidance of contagion in case
  of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.
* Be governed by the Threshold Council until we can land on a longer-term
  cross-chain governance mechanism.

== Initial implementation

The goal of the initial implementation is to bring Bitcoin to the following L2s
and sidechains:

* Arbitrum,
* Polygon,
* Optimism.

The cross-bridge architecture and patterns we are going to choose should allow
us to scale to other L2s, sidechains, and chains quickly.

=== Minting on L1

Rather than change our L1 implementation to be aware of L2s and sidechains,
we'll start as simply as possible. Every tBTC mint will continue to require
transactions on Ethereum from the user — first a deposit reveal, then a lock  
to bridge to another network.

=== Canonical token

The canonical token we are going to deploy will be different from the L1 token
deployed at `0x18084fbA666a33d37592fA2633fD49a74DD93a88`. The L2/sidechain token
will be upgradeable, owned by Threshold Council, will delegate the minting
authority to multiple parties, and have a pause functionality for mints and
burns.

Given those requirements, the address of the canonical tBTC token on L2s and
sidechains will be different from the one deployed on L1.

A generic implementation of the token will be provided in the `solidity` smart
contracts directory.

=== Supporting native bridges

A number of relevant chains include "native" bridges — canonical bridges for the
chain that require interoperability. These bridges are both the most important
and the trickiest to support.

Each native bridge has its own way mechanism to manage an Ethereum-to-chain
token contract mapping, sometimes called a token registry.

Examples of chains with native bridges include:

* Arbitrum,
* Polygon,
* Optimism.

==== Arbitrum native bridge

Since our tBTC L2 token is upgradeable and will allow multiple minting
authorities, the Arbitrum Standard ERC20 Gateway is not sufficient.

Given our tBTC L1 token does not conform to `ICustomToken` interface, we can not
use Arbitrum Generic Custom Gateway.

The only option is to implement our custom gateway that will have a minting
authority for Arbitrum L2 tBTC token.

One working example of a custom gateway is the DAI gateway:

* The L1 gateway contract: link:https://etherscan.io/address/0xD3B5b60020504bc3489D6949d545893982BA3011[`L1DaiGateway`],
* The L2 gateway contract: link:https://arbiscan.io/address/0x467194771dAe2967Aef3ECbEDD3Bf9a310C76C65[`L2DaiGateway`].

Another working example of a custom gateway is the Livepeer gateway:

* The L1 gateway contract: link:https://etherscan.io/address/0x6142f1C8bBF02E6A6bd074E8d564c9A5420a0676[`L1LPTGateway`],
* The L2 gateway contract: link:https://arbiscan.io/address/0x6D2457a4ad276000A615295f7A80F79E48CcD318[`L2LPTGateway`].

This is out of the scope of the initial implementation.

See link:https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging[Arbitrum documentation for token bridging]
for more information.

==== Polygon native bridge

For similar reasons as for Arbitrum, we have to implement our custom `FxTunnel`
implementation. The child tunnel implementation on the Polygon sidechain will
have a minting authority for the Polygon tBTC token.

This is out of the scope of the initial implementation.

See link:https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal[Polygon FxPortal documentation]
for more information.

==== Optimism native bridge

The Optimism Standard Bridge creates L2 token with a call to
`OptimismMintableERC20Factory`. The created token does not have the capabilities
we expect from tBTC canonical tokens on L2. For this reason, using the Optimism
Standard Bridge is not an option and we must implement our own L2 minter
contract with an authority to mint Optimism tBTC. Note that going back from L2
to L1 will take at least one week given the one-week Optimism challenge period.

This is out of the scope of the initial implementation.

See link:https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/standard-bridge-standard-token[Optimism guide for the standard bridge]
and link:https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#fees-for-l2-%E2%87%92-l1-transactions[Optimism documentation on sending data between L1 and L2]
for more details.

=== Supporting cross-ecosystem bridges

Selected cross-ecosystem bridges will be given minting authority for tBTC token
on L2 and sidechains.

Usually, the process of bridging from L1 to L2 (or sidechain) looks as follows
on a high level:

* There is a tBTC holder on L1. The holder goes to the Bridge dApp and
  selects the chain they want to bridge to.
* The holder submits one transaction to L1 locking their tBTC tokens in the
  bridge's smart contract. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15
  minutes for the Ethereum block finality.
* The holder submits one transaction to L2 that is minting tokens. After that
  transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on L2.

Usually, the process of bridging from L2 (or sidechain) to L1 looks as follows
on a high level:

* There is a tBTC holder on L2. That holder goes to the Bridge dApp and
  selects one of the L2 chains they want to bridge from.
* The holder submits one transaction to L2 that is burning the token. After the
  transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for the L2 block finality.
* The holder submits one transaction to L1 unlocking their tBTC tokens from the
  bridge's smart contract. After that transaction is mined, they have their tBTC
  on L1.

What is not immediately obvious is that the token received on L2 may not be the
canonical token on that L2.

To fully use the capabilities of cross-ecosystem bridges and make the user
experience seamless, we will implement a gateway contract having the authority to
wrap bridge-specific tokens into tBTC tokens in a 1:1 ratio. This contract
will have a minting authority for tBTC on L2. This way, no liquid market has to
exist on any target chain for users to be able to cross the Wormhole bridge into
the canonical tBTC.

IMPORTANT: The requirement for a seamless user experience is that the development
team of the given cross-ecosystem bridge has to integrate the step of wrapping the
token using the gateway contract into the bridging flow, in the same transaction as
the L2 confirmation.

==== Example

For example, when I crossed the bridge with ETH using Wormhole, I received WETH
token at address link:https://arbiscan.io/token/0xd8369c2eda18dd6518eabb1f85bd60606deb39ec[`0xd8369c2eda18dd6518eabb1f85bd60606deb39ec`].
This is not the canonical WETH on Arbitrum. The canonical WETH on Arbitrum is
link:https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1[`0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1`].
When I crossed the bridge with USDC I received USDC token at
link:https://arbiscan.io/token/0xc96f2715e2a242d50d1b0bc923dbe1740b8ecf18[`0xc96f2715e2a242d50d1b0bc923dbe1740b8ecf18`]
which is not the canonical USDC on Arbitrum. The canonical USDC on Arbitrum is
link:https://arbiscan.io/token/0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8[`0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8`].

Wormhole cannot magically mint all tokens on Arbitrum or other L2s. Wormhole
mints its own token representing the bridged asset that may be swapped to the
canonical representation on the given L2 assuming there is a market for such
a swap. The overview of liquid markets on each target chain is available in the
link:https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/overview-liquid-markets[Wormhole documentation].
Not every chain and token pair has a market. 

=== Multisig governance

The Governance in the initial implementation should be based on Gnosis Safe
6-of-9 Threshold Council Multisig. Since the Gnosis Safe for Threshold Council
was deployed using Safe Proxy factory v1.3.0, it
link:https://help.safe.global/en/articles/5267779-i-sent-assets-to-a-safe-address-on-the-wrong-network-any-chance-to-recover[should be possible]
to replay the same transaction creating Gnosis Safe with the same address on the
supported L2s and sidechains.

The Governance will be able to add and remove minters to L2/sidechain tBTC
canonical contract.

=== Code organization

The code that exists in the `solidity` directory should contain components
specific to L1 and generic L2 components that will be reused between EVM
L2 and sidechain implementations. The code specific to individual chains should
be placed in a chain-specific directory, in a separate NPM project:
`cross-chain/{$chainName}`.

For example:

* `cross-chain/arbitrum`,
* `cross-chain/polygon`,
* `cross-chain/optimism`.

Each `cross-chain` project should contain L1 and L2
contracts specific to that individual subchain. This separation will allow us to
abstract out the complexity of deployment and avoid redeploying all L1 testnet
contracts in case a single change in one of L2 contracts is needed.

This organization of the code will also allow us to not add subchain-specific
dependencies to the L1 project and to deploy NPM packages separately:

* `@keep-network/tbtc-v2-arbitrum`,
* `@keep-network/tbtc-v2-polygon`,
* `@keep-network/tbtc-v2-optimism`.

Every chain requires its own network and compiler configuration.
The `@keep-network/tbtc-v2` package is quite heavy and there is no
straightforward way to distinguish on which chain the given contract was
deployed if we do not separate NPM packages.

Each project should have its own CI process that may incorporate jobs specific
to that chain if needed. 

The CI processes of `cross-chain` projects should include Sepolia deployment
jobs. Note that the separation of the code does not mean the deployment is fully
separated between chains. Both L1 and L2 contracts need to be deployed from the
given `cross-chain` module. L1 contracts may require addresses of contracts from
L2 and L2 contract addresses may require addresses of contracts from L1.

           └── PolygonTBTC.sol 
```

`L2TBTC.sol` is an abstract contract doing all the heavy lifting: upgradeability,
authorization of minters, and minting pause. This generic contract is inherited
by L2-specific tokens: `ArbitrumTBTC`, `OptimismTBTC`, and `PolygonTBTC`.

Each `cross-chain` module has its own `package.json` so it's an independent
project with a separate NPM package deployment job and CI jobs.

Both L1 and L2 contracts specific to the given chain are placed next to each
other. For example, `ArbitrumL1Gateway` deployed on L1 Ethereum, and
`ArbitrumL2Gateway` deployed on L2 Arbitrum. It means the deployment job of the
given `cross-chain` module must be able to work both with L1 and L2 and to wire
up contracts together.

==== Initial implementation

The initial implementation uses the Wormhole bridge to bring tBTC to Arbitrum,
Optimism, and Polygon.

Smart contracts involved:

* Wormhole `TokenBridge` on Ethereum is the contract deployed at

* Wormhole `TokenBridge` on Optimism is the contract deployed at

* `L2WormholeGateway` on each chain is a smart contract wrapping and unwrapping
  Wormhole-specific tBTC representation into the canonical tBTC token on the
  given chain. This contract needs to be implemented and deployed behind an
  upgradeable proxy.
* `ArbitrumTBTC`, `PolygonTBTC`, and `OptimismTBTC` are token contracts with
  a minting authority delegated to `L2WormholeGateway`. This is the canonical
  tBTC token on the given chain. This contract needs to be implemented.

The full list of Wormhole deployed contracts is available link:https://book.wormhole.com/reference/contracts.html[here].

==== Extended implementation

The extended implementation adds support for native L2/sidechain bridges and
other cross-ecosystem bridges. Each L1 and L2 gateway needs to be implemented
separately given the specific requirements of cross-chain communication of the
given L2/sidechain. Multiple contracts have a minting authority for
each L2/sidechain tBTC canonical token: cross-ecosystem gateways and the native
bridge gateway.

== Future work

=== Minting on L2

Canonical tBTC token implementation on each L2/sidechain will allow delegating
the minting authority to new contracts. Such a contract could be an L1 vault
implementation other than the `TBTCVault`. In this model, tBTC for the given
Bitcoin deposit is minted on L2 directly, without minting it on L1. The L1
`Bank` balance is locked under the given vault implementation.

The main challenge of the native L2 minting is extending TBTC L1 minting
authority to bridges allowing to go from L2 to L1 with tBTC tokens minted on L2.

=== Replacing multi-sig governance

It is possible to implement a communication gateway for each L2/sidechain
allowing the DAO from L1 to vote on changes that would be reflected on
L2/sidechain. This is a potential mechanism to replace Threshold Council
ownership of L2/sidechain canonical tBTC token with the Threshold DAO ownership.
