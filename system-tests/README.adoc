== Run system tests

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >14.17.4
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >1.22.10

=== Install dependencies

To install dependencies, run:
```
yarn install
```

=== Bitcoin network requirements

Test scenarios implemented in the `test` directory require
a connection to the ElectrumX server synced with a Bitcoin
network. Each test scenario can also define its own
requirements related to the Bitcoin network. For example,
deposit-related scenarios require a BTC account with a
sufficient BTC balance. Please refer the documentation of
specific test scenarios for more details.

Theoretically, system tests should work on any Bitcoin network.
However, we recommend to stick with the Bitcoin testnet as
it is the easiest starting point.

=== Ethereum network requirements

All test scenarios require a connection to the Ethereum
network with tBTC v2 contracts deployed on. Each of the
test scenarios can also define a specific contract
state required to make a successful pass. For example,
deposit-related scenarios typically require a live wallet
registered on the `Bridge` contract.

System tests should work with any Ethereum network.
Those network configurations should be placed in
the link:hardhat.config.ts[Hardhat config file].
However, the easiest way to run the system tests
is using the Hardhat local network in the standalone mode.
This network is very flexible, especially when
paired with the test utils exposed by the `solidity`
module. Those utils are exposed as Hardhat tasks, and
they allow to configure the desired contract state
in a seamless way. For example, they provide an
easy way to register sortition pool operators and
create a live wallet that can be used for deposits
and redemptions. To get more details, go to the
`solidity` module and do:
```
npx hardhat --help | grep test-utils
```

=== Run test scenario

Specific tests scenarios can be invoked using:
```
ELECTRUM_URL=<electrum-url> \
 CONTRACTS_DEPLOYMENT_EXPORT_FILE_PATH=<cde-file-path> \
 yarn test ./test/<scenario>.test.ts --network <ethereum-network>
```
where:

- `electrum-url` points to the ElectrumX server
- `cde-file-path` contains the path of the contracts deployment export file.
  This is the JSON file produced as the outcome of the Hardhat Deploy plugin run.
- `scenario` denotes the test file name
- `ethereum-network` contains one of the Ethereum network names defined in the
  Hardhat config. Note that for the system tests we have a dedicated network called
  "system_tests".

Apart from those properties, each test scenario can require some additional
options passed as environment variables.

Please refer to a specific test scenario
documentation and current link:test/utils/context.ts[system tests context implementation]
for details.

We recommend running specific test scenarios separately and avoid running
them in batch using `yarn test`. Specific scenarios may require a completely
different network and contract state prerequisites so running them like
common tests may not be a good idea.

=== Example configuration with Bitcoin testnet and Hardhat local Ethereum network

This example shows how to run the basic
link:test/deposit-redemption.test.ts[single deposit and redemption roundtrip]
scenario using Bitcoin testnet and Hardhat local Ethereum network.

First, open a shell instance and jump into `solidity` directory. Once
done, install dependencies if required (`yarn install`) and compile
the contracts using:
```
yarn build
```
This will produce the contract artifacts. Now we need to run local Ethereum
network using Hardhat.

```
npx hardhat node --no-deploy
```

Since the local Ethereum node is running, we are ready to deploy contracts to
our `system_tests` network.

```
USE_EXTERNAL_DEPLOY=true npx hardhat deploy --network system_tests --export export.json
```

This command will deploy the contracts by running all the
link:../solidity/deploy[tBTC v2 contracts deployment scripts]. The
`--export` flag indicates that the deployment info will be exported
as the `export.json` file.

We now have a running Hardhat local network with the fresh tBTC v2 contracts
deployed on. The scenario we're trying to run requires a live wallet
to be registered into the `Bridge` contract. We can easily achieve that
using the test utils exposed by the `solidity` package. In order to do that,
run a second shell instance, go to the `solidity` dir and trigger:
```
npx hardhat test-utils:register-operators --network system_tests
```
This command will register the sortition pool operators. This is the first
step required to create a live wallet. The `--network` flag points to
`system_tests` since the Hardhat local network instance we have started previously
runs in a standalone mode and is available under this built-in network
configuration. The next step is triggering the actual DKG process that
will create the wallet in result:
```
npx hardhat test-utils:create-wallet --wallet-public-key <wallet-public-key> --network system_tests
```
The `wallet-public-key` is an arbitrary, `0x`-prefixed, uncompressed
ECDSA public key of the wallet (64-byte). It doesn't matter which one is actually used.
The only thing relevant here is its corresponding private key that will
be required in further steps.

Once done, the state of the tBTC v2 contracts should be as expected.
The test scenario can be started using:
```
ELECTRUM_URL=wss://electrumx-server.test.tbtc.network:8443 \
 CONTRACTS_DEPLOYMENT_EXPORT_FILE_PATH=../solidity/export.json \
 WALLET_BITCOIN_WIF=<wallet-bitcoin-wif> \
 DEPOSITOR_BITCOIN_WIF=<depositor-bitcoin-wif> \
 yarn test ./test/deposit-redemption.test.ts --network system_tests
```
Most of the parameters were explained in the previous sections. Worth noting
that this scenario requires two additional ones:

- `wallet-bitcoin-wif` that should contain the wallet's private
  key in the WIF format. This is the private key that should match the public
  key of the wallet generated in the previous step.
- `depositor-bitcoin-wif` that should contain the depositor's
  private key in the WIF format. This is an arbitrary BTC account with a
  sufficient BTC balance
