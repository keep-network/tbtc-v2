This package contains Yearn components (like strategies) intended to be used
with Yearn vaults working on top of tBTC v2.

== Strategies

=== `CurveVoterProxyStrategy` contract

This strategy is meant to be used with the Curve tBTC v2 pool vault.
The vault's underlying token (a.k.a. want token) should be the LP
token of the Curve tBTC v2 pool. This strategy borrows the vault's
underlying token up to the debt limit configured for this strategy
in the vault. In order to make the profit, the strategy deposits
the borrowed tokens into the gauge contract of the Curve tBTC v2 pool.
Depositing tokens in the gauge generates regular CRV rewards and
can provide additional rewards (denominated in another token)
if the gauge stakes its deposits into the Synthetix staking
rewards contract. The financial outcome is settled upon a call
of the `harvest` method (`BaseStrategy.sol`). Once that call is made,
the strategy harvests the CRV rewards from the pool's gauge. Then,
it takes a small portion (defined by `keepCRV` param) and locks it
into the Curve vote escrow (via `CurveYCRVVoter` contract) to gain CRV
boost and increase future gains. The rest of CRV tokens is used to
buy wBTC via a decentralized exchange. If the pool's gauge supports
additional rewards from Synthetix staking, the strategy claims
that reward too and uses obtained reward tokens to buy more wBTC.
At the end, the strategy takes acquired wBTC and deposits them
to the Curve tBTC v2 pool. This way it obtains new LP tokens
the vault is interested for, and makes the profit in result.
At this stage, the strategy may repay some debt back to the vault,
if needed. The entire cycle repeats for the strategy lifetime so
all gains are constantly reinvested. Worth to flag that current
implementation uses wBTC as the intermediary token because
of its liquidity and ubiquity in BTC-based Curve pools.

=== `ConvexStrategy` contract

This strategy is meant to be used with the Curve tBTC v2 pool vault.
The vault's underlying token (a.k.a. want token) should be the LP
token of the Curve tBTC v2 pool. This strategy borrows the vault's
underlying token up to the debt limit configured for this strategy
in the vault. In order to make the profit, the strategy deposits
the borrowed tokens into the Convex reward pool via the Convex
booster contract. Depositing tokens in the reward pool generates
regular CRV and CVX rewards. It can also provide extra rewards
(denominated in another token) if the Convex reward pool works on
top of a Curve pool gauge which stakes its deposits into the
Synthetix staking rewards contract. The financial outcome is settled
upon a call of the `harvest` method (`BaseStrategy.sol`). Once that
call is made, the strategy gets the CRV and CVX rewards from Convex
reward pool, and claims extra rewards if applicable. Then, it takes
a small portion of CRV (defined by `keepCRV` param) and locks it
into the Curve vote escrow (via `CurveYCRVVoter` contract) to gain
CRV boost and increase future gains. Remaining CRV, CVX, and
optional extra reward tokens are used to buy wBTC via a
decentralized exchange. At the end, the strategy takes acquired wBTC
and deposits them to the Curve tBTC v2 pool. This way it obtains new
LP tokens the vault is interested for, and makes the profit in
result. At this stage, the strategy may repay some debt back to the
vault, if needed. The entire cycle repeats for the strategy lifetime
so all gains are constantly reinvested. Worth to flag that current
implementation uses wBTC as the intermediary token because
of its liquidity and ubiquity in BTC-based Curve pools.

Long story short, this strategy is a more sophisticated version of the
`CurveVoterProxyStrategy` because it uses Convex as intermediary instead
of interacting with Curve directly. In result, it obtains CVX tokens which
increase their profit. However, this strategy incurs additional fees and
distributes extra rewards using a different model. This should be taken
into account when comparing profitability of different strategies.

=== `SaddleStrategy` contract

This strategy is meant to be used with the Saddle tBTC v2 pool vault.
The vault's underlying token (a.k.a. want token) should be the LP
token of the tBTC v2 Saddle pool. This strategy borrows the vault's
underlying token up to the debt limit configured for this strategy
in the vault. In order to make the profit, the strategy deposits
the borrowed tokens into the tBTC v2 Saddle reward pool. Depositing
tokens in the reward pool generates KEEP token rewards.
The financial outcome is settled upon a call of the `harvest` method
(BaseStrategy.sol). Once that call is made, the strategy gets the
KEEP token rewards from Saddle reward pool. These reward tokens are
then used to buy wBTC via a decentralized exchange. At the end, the
strategy takes acquired wBTC and deposits them to the Saddle tBTC v2
pool. This way it obtains new LP tokens the vault is interested in,
and makes the profit in result. At this stage, the strategy may
repay some debt back to the vault, if needed. The entire cycle
repeats for the strategy lifetime, so all gains are constantly
reinvested. Worth to flag that the current implementation uses wBTC
as the intermediary token because of its liquidity and ubiquity in
BTC-based Curve pools.

== Build, test and deploy

Yearn components use https://hardhat.org/[*Hardhat*] development environment.
To build and deploy these contracts, please follow the instructions presented
below.

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >12.22.1
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >1.22.10

=== Build contracts

To build the smart contracts, install node packages first:
```
yarn install
```
Once packages are installed, you can build the smart contracts using:
```
yarn build
```
Compiled contracts will land in the `build` directory.

=== Test contracts

There are multiple system test scenarios living in the `test/system` directory.
They all leverage the Hardhat mainnet forking feature which allow to test
contract using mainnet state.
You can run them by doing:
```
FORKING_URL=<url> yarn test:system
```
where `FORKING_URL` is an URL of an Ethereum mainnet node with access to
archival data (Alchemy recommended)

=== Deploy contracts

To deploy all contracts on the given network, please run:
```
yarn deploy --network <network>
```
If applicable, use environment variables listed in the
<<deployment-parametrization>> section.

To deploy a single contract, use the same command with the `--tags` option
followed by the contract name:
```
yarn deploy --network development --tags ConvexStrategy
```

If contracts haven't been built yet or changes occurred, this task will build
the contracts before running the deployment script. This command produces
an `export.json` file containing contract deployment info.

Please note that all strategies contracts make a call to their vault contract
upon initialization. That means the deployment will fail if the vault address
passed in the strategy constructor does not point to a contract compatible
with the Yearn vault API.

[[deployment-parametrization]]
==== Deployment parametrization

The following environment variables should be used for deployment parametrization.

|===
|Variable|Description

| `GAS_LIMIT`
| Custom gas limit for the deployment transaction. Can be useful in case when
  the environment cannot estimate the gas limit itself.
