  # We intend to use `workflow dispatch` in two different situations/paths:
  # 1. If a workflow will be manually dispatched from branch named
  #    `dapp-development`, workflow will deploy the contracts on the selected
  #    testnet and publish them to NPM registry with `dapp-dev-<environment>`
  #    suffix and `dapp-development-<environment>` tag. Such packages are meant
  #    to be used locally by the team developing Threshold Token dApp and may
  #    contain contracts that have different values from the ones used on
  #    mainnet.
  # 2. If a workflow will be manually dispatched from a branch which name is not
  #    `dapp-development`, the workflow will deploy the contracts on the
  #    selected testnet and publish them to NPM registry with `<environment>`
  #    suffix and tag. Such packages will be used later to deploy public
  #    Threshold Token dApp on a testnet, with contracts resembling those used
  #    on mainnet.
