      # We need this step because the `@keep-network/tbtc` which we update in
      # next steps has a dependency to `@summa-tx/relay-sol@2.0.2` package, which
      # downloads one of its sub-dependencies via unathenticated `git://`
      # protocol. That protocol is no longer supported. Thanks to this step
      # `https://` is used instead of `git://`.
