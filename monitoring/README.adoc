== How it works?

=== Architecture

The high-level architecture of the monitoring tool looks as follows:
```
       +------------------+
       |                  |
       |  tBTC v2 system  |
       |                  |
       +------------------+
               ^  ^
               |  |
        +------+  +------+
        |                |
        |                |
 +------+------+  +------+------+
 |             |  |             |
 |  Monitor 1  |  |  Monitor 2  |
 |             |  |             |
 +------+------+  +------+------+
        |                |
        |                |
        +------+  +------+
               |  |
               v  v
          +------------+      +---------------+
          |            |      |               |
          |  Manager   +----->|  Persistence  |
          |            |      |               |
          +----+--+----+      +---------------+
               |  |
               |  |
        +------+  +------+
        |                |
        v                v
+--------------+  +--------------+
|              |  |              |
|  Receiver 1  |  |  Receiver 2  |
|              |  |              |
+--------------+  +--------------+
```

Specific components are:

- *tBTC v2 system*: On-chain smart contracts
- *Monitors*: Components that observe the *tBTC v2 system* and generate
  appropriate system events according to their internal logic
- *Manager*: Main component that manages the given monitoring run.
  Gathers the system events generated by the
  *Monitors* and dispatches them to registered *Receivers*
- *Persistence*: Component that persists *Manager*'s processing data
- *Receivers*: Components that receive system events from the *Manager*
  and decide about handling or ignoring them

Such a structure gives great flexibility and allows to easily extend the
monitoring tool as new *Monitors* and *Receivers* can be implemented
without hassle and the *Persistence* component can be swapped anytime.

=== The flow

The monitoring tool is meant to be used in a script-like way, i.e. triggered
in a loop with fixed delays between subsequent runs. A single run always
focuses on a specific chain block window. The window's starting block is
determined based on the previous run's end block held by the *Persistence*
component (the so-called checkpoint block). The starting block is also
decremented by a constant factor of 12 to cover possible chain reorganizations.
The window's ending block is always the latest mined block (i.e. the chain tip).
For example, assuming that initial checkpoint block is 100, the loop will look
as follows:

- Run 1: Start block 100 - 12 = 88, end block 150
- Run 2: Start block 150 - 12 = 138, end block 155
- Run 3: Start block 155 - 12 = 143, end block 200

This way we are achieving a sliding block window that covers the entire
chain. Worth noting, the checkpoint block is updated only if the given run
completes with success. A run is considered successful when no single error was
thrown by any of the components. If the run is not successful, the checkpoint
block is not updated and the next run will cover the failed range again:

- Run 1: Start block 100 - 12 = 88, end block 150 - failed
- Run 2: Start block 100 - 12 = 88, end block 170 - failed
- Run 3: Start block 100 - 12 = 88, end block 200 - success
- Run 4: Start block 200 - 12 = 188, end block 250 - success

This way the monitoring tool guarantees to not miss any system events.
However, such a solution can produce duplicated system events. To prevent
that, the *Manager* component contains a deduplication logic that leverages
the *Persistence* component to filter out already handled system events.

== Build and deployment

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] =14 (newer versions are not supported temporarily)
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >1.22.0

=== Install dependencies

To install dependencies, run:
```
yarn install
```

**NOTE:** This package contains some transitive dependencies that are referenced
via the unauthenticated `git://` protocol. That protocol is no longer supported
by GitHub. This means that in certain situations installation of the package or
update of its dependencies using Yarn may result in `The unauthenticated git
protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported` or `fatal: unable to connect
to github.com` errors.

As a workaround, we advise changing Git configuration to use `https://` protocol
instead of `git://` by executing:

```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

=== Build

To build the library, invoke:
```
yarn build
```
A `dist` directory containing the resulting artifacts will be created.

=== Run

A single run of the monitoring tool can be triggered using the Node runtime:
```
node .
```

The behavior can be configured using the following env variables:
[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Variable |Description |Mandatory

|*ENVIRONMENT* |_mainnet_ or _testnet_ |Yes

|*ETHEREUM_URL* |URL of the Ethereum node |Yes

|*ELECTRUM_URL* |URL of the Electrum node |Yes

|*LARGE_DEPOSIT_THRESHOLD_SAT* |Satoshi threshold used to determine which deposits are large. Default: _1000000000_ |No

|*DATA_DIR_PATH* |Directory used to persist processing data. Default: _./data_ |No

|*SENTRY_DSN* |DSN of the Sentry receiver. If not set, events are not dispatched to Sentry |No

|*DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL* |URL of the Discord receiver webhook. If not set, events are not dispatched to Discord |No
|===

=== Deployment

==== Docker image

The monitoring tool can be used as a Docker container. To build the image
invoke:
```
docker build -t tbtc-v2-monitoring .
```

Once the image is built, a single run of the monitoring tool can be triggered by doing:
```
docker run --volume /$(pwd)/data:/mnt/data \
  --env DATA_DIR_PATH=/mnt/data \
  --env <other-envs> \
  tbtc-v2-monitoring
```

==== Kubernetes

The monitoring tool can be deployed on Kubernetes as a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/[`CronJob`].
Example configuration can be found https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/14d5f7331087a49b8d5d1ec7f8b534f8152a9175/infrastructure/kube/templates/tbtc-v2-monitoring/tbtc-v2-monitoring-cronjob.yaml[here].
