== High-level structure

The monitoring and telemetry system has the following high-level structure:

[source,mermaid]

    A[Threshold Dashboard] -->|Deposit data| B(Second track deposit verifier)
    B --> |Status| A
    A --> |Telemetry| C(Sentry)
    D[TBTCv2 minters and guardians] --> |Telemetry| C
    C -->|Alerts| E(PagerDuty)

There are several sources of monitoring and telemetry data:

* https://github.com/threshold-network/token-dashboard[Threshold dashboard] + https://github.com/keep-network/v2-end-to-end[second track deposit verifier]
* https://github.com/keep-network/optimistic-minting[TBTCv2 minters and guardians]
* https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/tree/main/monitoring[TBTCv2 monitoring]

Monitoring and telemetry data are gathered by Sentry hub. Collected data are used to produce and send alerts to:

* https://www.pagerduty.com/[PagerDuty]
* Discord channels

== Sources of data

Each source produces a different kind of monitoring and telemetry data. Here is
a detailed description of each data source.

=== Threshold dashboard

The dashboard instances collect the following telemetry data that are sent
directly to Sentry hub:

* generated deposit data,
* unhandled errors.

==== Generated deposit data

Each time a new deposit address is generated, the dashboard collects the
following data:

* BTC address of the deposit
* JSON recovery file content
* Second track deposit verification result

Worth noting that those data are send to the telemetry regardless of whether
the user actually funded and revealed the deposit. Those data are collected
in order to help users with potential deposit reveals that have not occurred
automatically and deposit recovery in case of wallet misbehavior. Last but not
least, all deposit addresses are checked against the second track deposit
verifier to make sure the address generation logic used by the dashboard is
proper and will not lead to fund loss.

[NOTE]
====
The second track deposit verifier is actually a Google Cloud Function named
https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/details/us-central1/verify-deposit-address?env=gen1&authuser=1&project=keep-prd-210b[`verify-deposit-address`]
living in the `keep-prd` GCP project. That function accepts some deposit data
and return a deposit BTC address computed using their own algorithm,
independent from the one used by the dashboard. See an https://us-central1-keep-prd-210b.cloudfunctions.net/verify-deposit-address/json/mainnet/latest/1fb2d377340f4b776ed2516b2293bd65fd205858/abb75eb77b3eb032/5efe583da177c3a421578a9a5ee4ad4837991474/390e4165[example call].
====

==== Unhandled errors

Apart from deposit data, all unhandled errors thrown by the dashboard are also
captured by the telemetry system. This allows to identify bugs encountered by
users in an automatic way.

=== TBTCv2 minters and guardians

The minters and guardians instances collect the following telemetry data that
are sent directly to Sentry hub:

* handled processing and validation errors,
* unhandled errors.

==== Handled processing and validation errors

During their work, the minters and guardians may encounter several errors
related to the processing logic and deposit validation. Most of them are
explicitly sent to the telemetry as errors or warnings. Examples of such
errors are:

* Revert of an Ethereum transaction created by the bot
* Failed validation of a revealed deposit

==== Unhandled errors

Apart from handled errors collected explicitly, all unhandled errors thrown by
the minters and guardians are also captured by the telemetry system.

=== TBTCv2 monitoring

The monitoring component inspects the tBTC v2 system on-chain contracts and
produce different kind of system events that are sent to Sentry and Discord
based on their type. A general rule of thumb is that notifications
(*i.e. informational sytem events*) are sent directly to Discord `pass:[*]-notifications`
channels while alerts requiring an action (*i.e. warning/critical system events*)
are propagated to the Sentry hub that decides about next steps. Specific system
events produced by the monitoring component are:

* deposit revealed,
* redemption requested,
* wallet registered,
* DKG result submitted,
* DKG result approved,
* DKG result challenged,
* large deposit revealed,
* large redemption requested,
* stale redemption,
* optimistic minting canceled,
* optimistic minting requested too early,
* optimistic minting requested for undetermined Bitcoin transaction,
* optimistic minting not requested by designated minter,
* optimistic minting not finalized by designated minter,
* optimistic minting not requested by any minter,
* optimistic minting not finalized by any minter,
* high TBTC token total supply change.

==== Deposit revealed

An *informational system event* indicating that a new deposit was revealed to
the on-chain Bridge contract. This event is directly sent to Discord as a
notification that does not require any action.

==== Redemption requested

An *informational system event* indicating that a new redemption was requested
from the on-chain Bridge contract. This event is directly sent to Discord as a
notification that does not require any action.

==== Wallet registered

An *informational system event* indicating that a new wallet was registered
on the on-chain Bridge contract. This event is directly sent to Discord as a
notification that does not require any action.

==== DKG result submitted

An *informational system event* indicating that a new DKG result was submitted
to the on-chain WalletRegistry contract. This event is directly sent to Discord
as a notification that does not require any action.

==== DKG result approved

An *informational system event* indicating that the submitted DKG result was
approved on the on-chain WalletRegistry contract. This event is directly sent to
Discord as a notification that does not require any action.

==== DKG result challenged

A *critical system event* indicating that the submitted DKG result was
challenged on the on-chain WalletRegistry contract. This event is sent to
Sentry hub and requires an immediate team’s action. The default action is
checking the reason of the challenge as that event may indicate a malicious
wallet operator or a serious bug in the off-chain client code.

==== Large deposit revealed

A *warning system event* indicating that a large deposit was revealed to the
on-chain Bridge contract. This event is sent to Sentry hub and should get
team’s attention. The default action is making sure that the deposit is
handled correctly by the system.

==== Large redemption requested

A *warning system event* indicating that a large redemption was requested from
the on-chain Bridge contract. This event is sent to Sentry hub and should get
team’s attention. The default action is making sure that the redemption is
not a result of a malicious action, and if not, that the redemption is
handled correctly by the system.

==== Stale redemption

A *warning system event* indicating that a redemption request became stale, i.e.
was not handled within the expected time. This event is sent to Sentry hub and
should get team’s attention. The default action is investigating the cause
of the extended processing time as this alert may be an early sign of
a malfunctioning wallet or may indicate a problem with the maintainer bot.

==== Optimistic minting cancelled

A *warning system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was
cancelled by a guardian. This event is sent to Sentry hub and should get
team’s attention. The default action is checking the reason of cancellation
as that event may indicate a malicious minter or guardian that should be
evicted from the system.

==== Optimistic minting requested too early

A *critical system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was
issued too early regarding their BTC funding transaction confirmation state.
This event is sent to Sentry hub and requires an immediate team’s action.
The default action is checking the reason of the early request as that event
may indicate a malicious minter that should be evicted from the system.

==== Optimistic minting requested for undetermined Bitcoin transaction

A *critical system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was
done for an undetermined Bitcoin transaction. This event is sent to Sentry
hub and requires an immediate team’s action. The default action is checking
why the Bitcoin transaction cannot be determined as that event may indicate
problems with the underlying Bitcoin client used by the monitoring component
or flag a malicious minter that should be evicted from the system.

==== Optimistic minting not requested by designated minter

A *warning system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was not
issued by the designated minter and another minter did that job. This event is
sent to Sentry hub and should get team’s attention. The default action is
investigating the cause of the designated minter idleness as the designated
minter may be unhealthy/malicious or there may be a bug in the minters
bot code.

==== Optimistic minting not finalized by designated minter

A *warning system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was not
finalized by the designated minter and another minter did that job. This event
is sent to Sentry hub and should get team’s attention. The default action is
investigating the cause of the designated minter idleness as the designated
minter may be unhealthy/malicious or there may be a bug in the minters
bot code.

==== Optimistic minting not requested by any minter

A *warning system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was not
issued by any minter. This event is sent to Sentry hub and should get team’s
attention. The default action is investigating the cause of the minters idleness
as the underlying deposit may be invalid, minters may be unhealthy/malicious or
there may be a bug in the minters bot code.

==== Optimistic minting not finalized by any minter

A *warning system event* indicating that an optimistic minting request was not
finalized by any minter. This event is sent to Sentry hub and should get team’s
attention. The default action is investigating the cause of the minters idleness
as the underlying deposit may be invalid, minters may be unhealthy/malicious or
there may be a bug in the minters bot code.

==== High TBTC token total supply change

A *critical system event* indicating that a high change (i.e. >=10%) of the
total TBTC v2 token supply took place in the last 12 hours. This event is sent
to Sentry hub and requires an immediate team’s action. The default action is
checking the root cause of the supply change and making sure its source is
actually a proper deposit/redemption and there are no signs of any malicious
action.

== Sentry hub

The monitoring and telemetry system uses Sentry as hub for relevant monitoring
and telemetry data that requires an action from the team. Here is a detailed
description of this component.

=== Configuration

The Sentry application has been configured in the following way:

* There is a https://keep-ko.sentry.io/projects[Keep] organization that groups
all invited members under the https://keep-ko.sentry.io/settings/teams/keep/members/[#Keep] team

* There are projects corresponding to specific monitoring and telemetry data sources:

** https://keep-ko.sentry.io/projects/prod-threshold-dashboard/?project=4504566725607424[prod-threshold-dashboard]
that collects telemetry from the production (mainnet) Threshold dashboard as
well as from production previews

** https://keep-ko.sentry.io/projects/test-threshold-dashboard/?project=4504564892827648[test-threshold-dashboard]
that collects telemetry from the test (Sepolia) Threshold dashboard as well as
from test previews

=== Alerts

As mentioned earlier, Sentry uses the collected monitoring and telemetry data
to raise alerts that are propagated to PagerDuty and Discord channels.
Here is the exact summary of configured alert rules:
