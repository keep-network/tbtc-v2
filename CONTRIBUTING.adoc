= Keep Contribution Guide

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Contributions are welcome from
anyone, and even the smallest of fixes is appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Keep and its packages.
Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

== Getting started

1. Fork https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2[`keep-network/tbtc-v2`]
2. Clone your fork
3. Each module has their own setup instructions. Follow the README of the
   specific module you want to contribute to.
4. Set up the <<Development Tooling>>.
5. Open a PR against the `main` branch and describe the change you are intending
   to undertake in the PR description.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

* It passes the linter checks (see <<Pre-commit>> to make this automatic).
* It passes the https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/actions[continuous
  integration tests].
* Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have
  been added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features)

== Development Tooling

Commits
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-commit-signature-verification[must
be signed].

=== Continuous Integration

Keep uses https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/actions[Github Actions] for
continuous integration. All jobs must be green to merge a PR.

=== Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are made.
It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter checks and avoid
pushing code that will not be accepted. Follow the
https://pre-commit.com/[installation instructions here], and then run
`pre-commit install` to install the hooks.

=== Linting

Linters and formatters for Solidity, JavaScript, and Go code are set up and run
automatically as part of pre-commit hooks. These are checked again in CI builds
to ensure they have been run and are passing.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, to the JavaScript or
Solidity linting, please propose these changes to our
https://github.com/keep-network/solium-config-keep[solium-config-keep] and
https://github.com/keep-network/eslint-config-keep[eslint-config-keep] packages.
All other packages have it as a dependency.

== Commit Messages

When composing commit messages, please follow the general guidelines listed in
https://cbea.ms/git-commit/[Chris Beamsâ€™s How to Write a Git Commit Message].
Many editors have git modes that will highlight overly long first lines of
commit messages, etc. The GitHub UI itself will warn you if your commit summary
is too long, and will auto-wrap commit messages made through the UI to 72
characters.

The above goes into good commit style. Some additional guidelines do apply,
however:

* The target audience of your commit messages is always "some person 10 years
  from now who never got a chance to talk to present you" (that person could be
  future you!).
* Commit messages with a summary and no description should be very rare. This
  means you should probably break any habit of using `git commit -m`.
* A fundamental principle that informs our use of GitHub: assume GitHub will
  someday go away, and ensure git has captured all important information about
  the development of the code. Commit messages are the piece of knowledge that
  is second most likely to survive tool transitions (the first is the code
  itself); as such, they must stand alone. Do not reference tickets or issues
  in your commit messages. Summarize any conclusions from the issue or ticket
  that inform the commit itself, and capture any additional reasoning or context
  in the merge commit.
* Make your commits as atomic as you can manage. This means each commit contains
  a single logical unit of work. 
* Run a quick `git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate` before pushing.
  Itâ€™s much easier to fix typos and minor mistakes locally.
